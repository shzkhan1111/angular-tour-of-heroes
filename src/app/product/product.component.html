<!-- Ran into error ran npm install -->
<h1>My Products</h1>
<div>
    <!-- This is cmming from a variable in Ts file-->
    <!-- string interpolation -->
    {{productName}}
<!-- Now change it on button click  
single '' because "" are intrepreted as typescript codde
-->
<!-- event binding -->
<button (click)="productName = 'A button'">text change </button>

<!-- property Binding -->
<!-- disabled added like an attribute -->
<button (click)="productName = 'A button'" disabled>disabled added like an attribute  </button>
<!-- but it also sets the property of an underlying Dom object and we can bind it by adding by 
adding [] -->
<button (click)="productName = 'A button'" [disabled] = "isDisabled">disabled added like an attribute Binding</button>
<button (click)="productName = 'A button'" (click) = "isDisabled = false">Button to enable previous button</button>
<br />
<p>Now Two way binding
    <br> use [()] and bind to ngModel [(ngModel)] and then provide the value you want to bind like 
    [(ngModel)] = 
    to enable ngModel directive app module and import an additional module
    <br>import  FormsModule from '@angular/forms';
and also add that module to the list of imports  in app.ts file

error was faced again to solve brackets were removed 
</p>

<input type="text" [(ngModel)] = "productName">
 <p><b>Directives</b></p>
<p>Click Button we add new product</p>


<p>Making it so that on disabled false it should not be shown
    the button will when button to enable previous is clicked
</p>
<button (click)="onAddProduct()" *ngIf="!isDisabled">not Disabled Add Product</button>
<button (click)="onAddProduct()" *ngIf="isDisabled">disabled Add Product</button>

<p>show the producs Array : we will use Directives using *ngFor
    <br> * tells angular that it is a structural directive that will change the element
</p>
<div *ngFor="let p of products">{{p}}</div>

</div>
<div>
    <h2>Custom binding and events</h2>
    <p>Component need to communicate with each other
        <br>now making a product component that encapulates a single product
        the input decorator is used to bind the value from child to parent
        to bind from the parent we will [value in child] = 'Value that needs to be passed'
    </p>
    <app-product-single-display (productClicked)="onRemoveProduct(p)"
     *ngFor="let p of products" [productName]="p"></app-product-single-display>
    <p>also the other way around when we change in child parent should be updated as well
        <br>
        We need to emit a custom event created by importing Event Emmiter and also Output
        <br>Output decorator is use to send data and we will <br>
        @0utput () productclicked = new EventEmitter();
        in the child<br>
        when the div section of the child is clicked it will emit an event which parent 
        will listen to 
        change in the previous code 

    </p>
</div>

<h2>Forms</h2>  
<form (ngSubmit)="AddProductViaForm(f)" #f="ngForm">
    <p>since we imported the forms module angular will manage it for us behind the scenes 
    prevent submision if we add a special event 
    and manages the validity of the form
    we can add form (ngSubmit) = "onAddProduct()"
    this will execute that whenever we submit the form 
    doing so we can remove the two way binding and in the input and set ngModel
    <<<< is replaced by & 
    &input type=text ngModel this will register the input as a control to angular then assign a 
    name and apply validators like required
    angular makes a js object storing the info about our form and we can get the reference to tat 
    by adding a local reference to the form element like # &form ...#xyz
    using this a and by assign = #xyz = "ngForm" angular detects the syntax and gives reference to form
    object it created implicitly behind the scenes
    and we can pass it into the &form (ngSubmit) ='fun(f)' #f = 'ngForm'
    for above example see console log after via form entire form oject is displayed
    </p>
    <input type="text" ngModel name = "productName" required>
    <button type="submit">Add Product Via Form</button>
    
</form>
